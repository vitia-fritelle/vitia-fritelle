Hi, there! I'm Vitor, but you can call me Витя. I am looking forward to learn more about front and back developments in web-based structures. 
I have a good knowledge in C/C++, and Python, and I also like numerical methods and applying them to EDOs/EDPs or another problem I would be seeing.
If u send me an e-mail, I will try to answer it as fast as possible! ^^
