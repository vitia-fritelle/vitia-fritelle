- 👋 Hi, there! I'm Vitor, but you can call me Витя. 
- 📚 I am looking forward to learn more about front and back developments in web-based structures. I am also studying data analysis.
- 👨‍🎓 I have a good knowledge in C/C++, and Python, and I also like numerical methods and applying them to EDOs/EDPs or another problem I would be seeing.
- 📧 If u send me an e-mail, I will try to answer it as fast as possible! ^^
- 😆 I like telling jokes... and expect others to laugh xD.
